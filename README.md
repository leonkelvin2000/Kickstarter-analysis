# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
Performing analysis on Kickstarter data to uncover trends.
For preparations to Louise's Kickstarter, I have listed some statistics on (Discriptive Statistics) on the likelyhood of how effective
Kickstarters campaigns are and to take into consideration how effective Musicals are in them. 
Musicals are 25% to not receive any pledges and its best to keep the budget to less then 2,000 Great British Pounds due to the median showing
the second quartile being 4000 Great British Pounds. Anything higher than the third Quartile as shown in (Box Plot of GB Musicals) would be
quite hard to reach when comparing goals and pledges.
Please see below to see charts to see that if you were to start a Kickstarter Campaign, it is best to start in at the beginning of May
or June which statistically have a higher chance of sucession.
Theater/Plays have the most date to be a Kickstarter Campaign and the chances of the sucession would be more certain as long as the goal 
is not above the median as shown on (Discriptive Statistics).
