# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
Performing analysis on Kickstarter data to uncover trends.
For preparations to Louise's Kickstarter, I have listed some statistics on (Discriptive Statistics) on the likelyhood of how effective
Kickstarters campaigns are and to take into consideration how effective Musicals are in them. 
Musicals are 25% to not receive any pledges and its best to keep the budget to less then 2,000 Great British Pounds due to the median showing
the second quartile being 4000 Great British Pounds. Anything higher than the third Quartile as shown in (Box Plot of GB Musicals) would be
quite hard to reach when comparing goals and pledges.
Please see below to see charts to see that if you were to start a Kickstarter Campaign, it is best to start in at the beginning of May
or June which statistically have a higher chance of sucession.
Theater/Plays have the most date to be a Kickstarter Campaign and the chances of the sucession would be more certain as long as the goal 
is not above the median as shown on (Discriptive Statistics).

# Kickstarting Challange with Excel

## Overview of Project

This is a Kickstarter Project analysis based on how well a campaign did based on their goals vs. launch dates 

## Purpose
The purpose of this analysis is to see if there is a possible trend on when will the best time to start will be and how much should the goal to be set expectations on how well pledged were made realistically. 
## Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
The analysis of outcomes based on launch date is that statistically theater outcomes are best successful when launched in May or June. May shows the best results by 11 points and June beats the rest by minimum of 13 points afterwards.

## Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
The analysis of outbased on goals is that the lower the goals the success rate percentage will be higer. The graph shows that once the goal rate is set to 15,000 to 19,999 - the percentage of sucess drops below 50% and steadly declines. There is an outlier to the data due to having 2 successful projects of 50,000 or more which causes the date to straw off a little.

## Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
A challange that I encountered were how to properly set percentages to then relay it to the pivot chart properly so when the Y-axis needed to properly show percentage - at first I was getting difficulties and get a difference of x100 due to the intial conversion. I learned once percentages are involved in graph, I need to makes sure the chart is properly converted and has its number format set properly to avoid inconsistency when translated to the pivot chart. 

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
My conclusion of outcomes based on launch dates is if you were to start a theater campaign, the data shows that its best to start is May primarily and if not June which shows the two best results. 

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
My conclusion of outcomes based on goals is that if you were to start a theater campaign, anything lesss then a 15,000 goal has higher then a 50% rate of succeeding. The two best results will be goals less then 5,000. Which if you did it from 1,000 to 5,000, the success rate will be at 73% and anything less then 1,000 will have a 76% rate. This is all depending on the depth of whats needed in the budget so 1,000 to 5,000 is a more realistic guideline to use for its budget. 
- What are some limitations of this dataset?
Some limitations that can affect this dataset could be external continential factors like global affairs between countries and can skew the dataset in certain years.
